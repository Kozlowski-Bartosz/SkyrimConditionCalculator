# Skyrim Condition Calculator
A simple tool that converts any logical notation into one that would be accepted by the Creation Kit's conditions system.

Currently it's just a single python file (ConditionCalc.py) that you can easily interpret on your own set-up, all it needs is sympy and mpmath. Plans are to give it an interface and perhaps publish as a web app later down the line.
